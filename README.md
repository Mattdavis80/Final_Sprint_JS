# Final_Sprint_JS

This project takes information form a JSON file and displays it on both the HTML page and in the console.

I used a forEach loop to iterate through each "Person" in the JSON file and retrieve the data

I then created a function to display the information to the HTML page by creating elements and appending them to the HTML Body. Some basic styling was applied for visual affect however the focus of this assignment using Fetch API in JavaScript

Overall, I enjoyed completing this project and learned a lot about how HTML pages can be manipulated using JavaScript! I now have a better understanding of how Fetch API works.
